You’ll learn how to clean data, draw plots, and how to find help when you’re stuck. These skills are vital for scientific research to happen, and we will go over best practices for doing each of these things with R.\nYou’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. Moreover, you’ll learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualizing, and exploring data.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"This course will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, and visualize it.","tags":null,"title":"","type":"authors"},{"authors":["manu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a32dd33c24474dbc18c03184b938ace8","permalink":"/authors/manu/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/manu/","section":"authors","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"authors"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"吳恩達 is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab.
