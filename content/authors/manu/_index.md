Hi everyone, I'm Manu!
I'm a research assistant at the Hutchins Center for Fiscal & Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution where I've worked on the [Fiscal Impact Measure](https://www.brookings.edu/interactives/hutchins-center-fiscal-impact-measure/), the [impact of COVID on international tourism](https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-covid-19-travel-shock-hit-tourism-dependent-economies-hard/), the [Fiscal Ship](https://fiscalship.org), and an [R package](https://brookingsinstitution.github.io/ggbrookings/) implementing the Brookings style guide in ggplot2.
