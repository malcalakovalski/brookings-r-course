Hi everyone, I'm Allison! I'm an Assistant Teaching Professor at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, where I teach statistics, data analysis, and science communication. I was also RStudio's 2019-2020 Artist-in-Residence, and you can find some of my R- and stats-related artwork [**here**](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations).
